// Generate placeholder images using https://placeholder.com
// This is just a note file to remind you to create placeholder images
// You can either:

// 1. Use these URLs as placeholders (replace in content.ts):
// - Tutoring image: "/images/memoji.jpg" (reuse your avatar temporarily)
// - Crater image: "/images/uofa_insightfactory.png" (reuse this image temporarily)

// 2. Or create actual images. You could create proper images:
// - Download an image of math/tutoring and save as public/images/tutoring.png 
// - Download an image of a crater/space and save as public/images/crater.png

// This is a convenience file to help you remember to create the images
// needed for the experiences section.
